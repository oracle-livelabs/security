# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Oracle Access Governance is a cloud-native identity governance and administration (IGA) service that provides enterprise-wide visibility to govern access to cloud and on-premises environments. With an intuitive user experience, dynamic access control, and a prescriptive analyticsâ€“driven access review process, it helps customers automate access provisioning, get insights into access permission and cloud infrastructure policy reviews, identify anomalies, and remediate security risks. Using advanced analytics, Oracle Access Governance offers an intuitive user experience, providing recommendations and insights into access entitlements, behaviors, and risks.

This workshop walks you through the steps to get started using Oracle Access Governance with use cases including **access controls** implementation, **user access reviews**, and **enterprise-wide** visibility for systems managed using Access Governance. In this workshop, a fictitious corporation is using Oracle Access Governance to manage and govern the application access of its employees and contractors. This lab shows how the database is connected to AG as a target system and implement access control by creating identity collections, approval workflows, roles, access bundles, and centralized policies. It also shows how to perform access review campaigns, and associated review tasks.

**Oracle Access Governance** allows :

- **Administrator** to perform various system, service, and access control administrative tasks
- **Campaign administrator** to run intelligent access review campaigns for access governance and compliance
- **Cloud Access Reviewers** to review policy access insights and take informed decisions based on **prescriptive analytics**
- **Users** and **user managers** to validate access assigned to self and their direct reports, respectively.
- **Access Control Administrator** to automate access through Access Bundles, Roles, Identity Collections, Policies, and Approval Workflows.
- **Users** to submit access requests for provisioning to various target systems.
