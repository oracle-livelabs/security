# Activation of the Identity Domain and Creating a Confidential App for REST API Calls

## Introduction

During the stack execution process, An Oracle Identity Domain of the type of **Oracle Apps Premium** is created. The administrator account you used will get an auto generated email for resetting the password for that respective user. In this module we will showcase the steps to reset the password for the admin users and the procedure to login into the newly created Oracle Apps Premium Domain. 

This module will also help you to create a confidential application under the newly created Identity Domain, which will be used for making REST API calls in the backend.

## Objectives

1.	**Reset** the password for the admin user and login into the newly created Identity Domain
2. 	Create a confidential application with the allowed grant type **Client Credentials**

## Task 1: Reset the password for the admin user and login into the newly created Domain

1. During the stack execution process you will get an autogenerated email which would have an **Activate your Account** Button. Please click on it.
