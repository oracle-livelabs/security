# Introduction

## About this Workshop
### Overview
*Estimated Time to complete the workshop*: 310 minutes

This workshop environment is dedicated to Oracle Database Security features and functionalities.

Based on an OCI architecture, deployed in a few minutes with a simple internet connection, it allows you to test DB Security use cases in a complete environment already pre-configured by the Oracle Database Security Product Manager Team.

Now, you no longer need important resources on your PC (storage, CPU or memory), nor complex tools to master, making you completely autonomous to discover at your rhythm all new DB Security features.

During this 1st part, you'll use different resources to interact with these VMs:
  - SSH Terminal Client
  - Glassfish HR App
