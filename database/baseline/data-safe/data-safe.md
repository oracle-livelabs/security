## Task 1: Register an on-premise Oracle Database with a Private endpoint

To use a database with Oracle Data Safe, you first need to register it into Oracle Data Safe.

There are two connectivity options available when registering an on-premises database:
- with an Oracle Data Safe private endpoint
- with an Oracle Data Safe on-premises connector

Please note: If you have a FastConnect or VPNConnect setup between your environment and the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), you can use a private endpoint. If you don't have such a connection setup (or don't want to use it for the registration), you can use an on-premises connector.
<p>For this LiveLab: If you run the workshop in your own tenancy, you can try both connectivity options (Task 1 and 2). If you run the workshop in the Sandbox environment, you can only use the private endpoint (Task 1).

In this lab, let's see how to register the dabase with a private endpoint

1. Open a web browser window to your OCI console and login with your OCI account

2. On the OCI menu in the upper left corner, click on **Oracle Database**, then on **Data Safe - Database Security**.

    ![Data Safe](./images/ds-001.png "Open Data Safe")
 
3. Click on "**Target databases**"

    ![Data Safe](./images/ds-002.png "Add Target Database")

4. On the **Connectivity Options** sub-menu, click  on **Private endpoints**

    ![Data Safe](./images/ds-003.png "Private endpoints")

5. Click the **Create private endpoint** button.

    ![Data Safe](./images/ds-004.png "Create private endpoint")

6. Fill out as following:

    - Name: `<Your Private Endpoint Name>` (here "*`DBSeclabs_PE-DBs`*")
    - Compartment: Select your Compartment
    - Virtual cloud network: Select your VCN
    - Subnet: Select your Subnet

       ![Data Safe](./images/ds-005.png "Set Private endpoint")

7. Click **Create private endpoint**

8. Once the private endpoint is created, the status of the private endpoint will go to **ACTIVE**.

       ![Data Safe](./images/ds-006.png "the Private endpoint is ACTIVE")
    
    **Note**:
    - A Private IP is assigned to this Private endpoint (here '10.0.0.140')
    - There's no target database register by default

9. Now, configure your target database to be registered into Data Safe

    - Open a Terminal session on your **DBSec-Lab** VM as OS user *oracle*

        ```
        <copy>sudo su - oracle</copy>
        ```

        **Note**: Only **if you are using a remote desktop session**, just double-click on the Terminal icon on the desktop to launch a session directly as oracle, so, in that case **you don't need to execute this command**!

    - Go to the scripts directory

        ```
        <copy>cd $DBSEC_LABS/data-safe</copy>
        ```

    - Create the Data Safe **`DS_ADMIN`** user on **`pdb1`**

        ```
        <copy>
        ./ds_create_user.sh pdb1
        </copy>
        ```

        ![Data Safe](./images/ds-007.png "Create the Data Safe DS_ADMIN user")

        **Note**:
        - The user `DS_ADMIN` is created into your target database with `ALL` the Data Safe admin roles
        - SQL Firewall is not supported for an Oracle Database version 19c

10. Go back to the Data Safe Console to register the Target database **pdb1**

    - Click on the **Private endpoints** link
    
    ![Data Safe](./images/ds-008.png "Click on the Private endpoints link")
    
    - Click on **Target Databases** sub-menu

    ![Data Safe](./images/ds-009.png "Click on Target Databases sub-menu")

    - Click [**Register Database**]

    ![Data Safe](./images/ds-010.png "Click Register Database")

    - Fill out the "Register Target Database" as following

        - Database Type: Select *`Oracle On-Premises Database`*
        - Data Safe Target Display Name: *`DBSeclabs_PE-DBs-pdb1`*
        - Description: *`On-Premises pluggable database of dbseclab VM (pdb1)`*
        - Compartment: Select your own Compartment

            ![Data Safe](./images/ds-011.png "Fill out the Register Target Database parameters")

        - Choose a connectivity option: *`Private endpoint`*
        - Select private endpoint: Select *`DBSeclabs_PE-DBs`*
        - TCP/TLS: *`TCP`*
        - Database Service Name: *`pdb1`*
        - Database IP Address: *`10.0.0.150`*
        - Database Port Number: *`1521`*
        - Database User Name: *`DS_ADMIN`* (in uppercase)
        - Database Password: *`Oracle123Oracle123!`*
    
            ![Data Safe](./images/ds-012.png "Fill out the Register Target Database parameters")

    - Click [**Register**] to launch the registration process

    - Once is registered, the target database must be "**ACTIVE**"

        ![Data Safe](./images/ds-013.png "Target Database registered")

        **Note:**
        - On the **Target database information** tab, you can view the target database name and description, OCID, when the target database was registered and the compartment to where the target database was registered.
        - You can also view connection information, such as database type, database service name, and connection protocol (TCP or TLS). The connection information varies depending on the target database type.
        - The **Target database information** page provides options to edit the target database name and description, edit connection details, update the Oracle Data Safe service account and password on the target database (applicable to non-Autonomous Databases), and download a SQL privilege script that enables features on your target database.
        - From the **More Actions** menu, you can choose to move the target database to a different compartment, add tags, deactivate your target database, and deregister your target database.

11. Click on the **Target Databases** link to view the list of registered target databases to which you have access

    ![Data Safe](./images/ds-014.png "View the list of registered target databases")

    **Note:** All your registered target databases are listed on the right

    ![Data Safe](./images/ds-015.png "List of registered target databases")

12. Now, your target database is registered in Data Safe!

13. Let's have a look on a quick overview of the Security Center

    - Click on **Overview** sub-menu

        ![Data Safe](./images/ds-016.png "Click on Overview sub-menu")

        **Note**: In Security Center, you can access all the Oracle Data Safe features, including the dashboard, Security Assessment, User Assessment, Data Discovery, Data Masking, Activity Auditing, Alerts, and Settings

    - Click on **Dashboard**
    
        ![Data Safe](./images/ds-017.png "Data Safe dashboard")

        **Note**:
        - Make sure your compartment is still selected under **List Scope**
        - When you register a target database, Oracle Data Safe automatically creates a security assessment and user assessment for you
        - Therefore, the Security Assessment, User Assessment, Feature Usage, and Operations Summary charts in the dashboard already have data
        - It can take several minutes to assess all the components, so if you don't see any data, please refresh the page
        - During registration, Oracle Data Safe also discovers audit trails on your target database
        - That is why the Audit Trails chart in the dashboard shows one audit trail with the status In Transition for your Autonomous Database
        - Later you start this audit trail to collect audit data into Oracle Data Safe

            ![Data Safe](./images/ds-018.png "Data Safe dashboard")
