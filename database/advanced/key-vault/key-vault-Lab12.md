# Explore Key Vault in a typical customer deployment

## Introduction
Oracle Key Vault offers continuously available, fault-tolerant, and highly scalable centralized management of encryption keys and secrets for all Oracle Database deployment models, addressing diverse organizational requirements. It securely stores and manages sensitive cryptographic material, including TDE master encryption keys, Oracle GoldenGate keys, SSH keys, public and private keys, digital certificates, and more.

Key Vault is purpose-built to manage TDE master encryption keys for standalone, multitenant, RAC, and sharded databases deployed on Exadata, Cloud, Cloud@Customer, and on Oracle Database Appliance. It also operates seamlessly across diverse infrastructure architectures, including multi-cloud and hybrid environments, as well as traditional on-premises and fully cloud-based deployments.

As a critical system component, proper Key Vault operation is essential to maintaining operational continuity. To support this, Key Vault provides comprehensive reporting and notifications, including inventory, activity, security, operational, and audit reports, with notifications delivered via email alerts, remote syslog, or SNMP.

Estimated Lab Time: 15 minutes

### Objectives

**OLD** - In this lab, you will explore the various types of Key Vault endpoints that can be deployed to different Oracle databases, as well as the virtual wallets used to organize and manage the keys for these databases. You will also explore Oracle Key Vault's actionable reports and how to interpret them - for example identifying which TDE master encryption keys need to be re-keyed, which certificates are nearing expiration or no longer satisfy stricter compliance requirements. You will also explore how system administrators can perform user management, mornitor system health and administer the key vault server.

**NEW** - In this lab, you will explore the different types of Key Vault endpoints for Oracle databases, and how virtual wallets organize database keys. You will also explore Oracle Key Vault's actionable reports and how to interpret them - for example identifying which TDE master encryption keys need to be re-keyed, which certificates are nearing expiration or no longer satisfy stricter compliance requirements. Youâ€™ll also learn how administrators manage users, monitor system health, and administer the Key Vault server.

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have completed lab 11.

## Task 1: Oracle Key Vault Home page 

1. Login to Key Vault as user **KVRESTADMIN**

    ![Key Vault](./images/image-2025-09-03_13-29-46.png "Login to Key Vault as user KVRESTADMIN")

2. On the home page, observe the following:

    - The **Alerts** banner summarizes critical items that need immediate attention which may impact operational continuity.
    - The **Managed Entities** provides a quick overview of the databases (endpoints) and the wallets (database).
    - The **Managed Keys & Secrets** gives a quick glance of all the managed cryptographic objects.

    ![Key Vault](./images/Screenshot_2025-10-04_15.32.37.png "On the home page, observe Alerts, Managed Entities, and Managed Keys & Secrets")

2. The System Overview section at the bottom identifies the system. At this time, the system is deployed as a standalone server.

    ![Key Vault](./images/image-2025-09-11-17.41.21.png "The System Overview section at the bottom identifies the system.")

## Task 2: Manage Primary-Standby, Sharded DBs, Multi-Tennant and RAC databses

Oracle Key Vault can manage databases of various deployments by deploying database clients called **endpoints** on the database host. The system administrator is tasked with creating, and overseeing endpoints on the Key Vault server. Endpoints can be deployed for Oracle databases, Oracle ACFS, MySQL databases, and SSH servers.

1. Click the **Endpoints** tab
    ![Key Vault](./images/image-2025-7-24_12-11-54.png "Click the Endpoints tab")

2. This takes you to the Endpoints page - where the system administrator can see information about the endpoints that are registered or enrolled with Key Vault.

    Note the endpoints that have been deployed in this example to various deployments of the Oracle database:
    - The 3 REGIONS endpoints are deployed for 3 different shards of the REGIONS database
    - The 2 SALES\_PURCHASE endpoint has been deployed to each node of the INVENTORY RAC database in the SALES CDB
    - Similarly the 2 SALES\_INVENTORY endpoints have been deployed to both nodes of the INVENTORY RAC database in the SALES CDB
    - The 2 STAFF endpoints are deployed to a primary and a standby STAFF database

    ![Key Vault](./images/image-2025-09-11-18.13.52.png "This takes you to the Endpoints page")

## Task 3: Virtual wallets for database keys 

To simplify management of database keys, Oracle Key Vault offers virtual wallets which act as a grouping mechanism to identify keys that belong to a specific database. Each virtual wallet can be mapped to a specific endpoint so that all keys uploaded by an endpoint become a part of this wallet by default. You can think of this wallet as the Key Vault representation of the local TDE wallet. The key administrator is responsible for creating and managing virtual wallets.

1. Click the **Keys & Wallets** tab
    ![Key Vault](./images/Screenshot_2025-10-04_15.43.07.png "Click the Keys & Wallets tab")

2. This takes you to the Wallets page - where the key administrator can manage these

    In the photo below, you can see that for the endpoints created in task 2, there exists a virtual wallet so that all keys of the corresponding database can be grouped together.

    ![Key Vault](./images/image-2025-09-11-18.20.43.png "This takes you to the Wallets page")

## Task 4: Inventory of database encryption keys

1. Click the **Reports** tab

    ![Key Vault](./images/Screenshot_2025-10-04_15.46.44.png "Click the Reports Tab")

2. Expand the **Key Management Reports for Oracle Endpoints**

    ![Key Vault](./images/image-2025-09-11-17.53.46.png "Key Management Report")

3. Select **DB Generated TDE Master Encryption Key Attribute Report**  - to see an example of a report with the inventory of database encryption keys

    Note the key metadata shown for ease of filtering:
    - You can see the user that created the key, the creating database and the creating PDB
    - You can also see the user that activated the key, and which database and PDB activated the key
    - You can check the time for when the database activated the key (no other key manager can do this)

    ![Key Vault](./images/Screenshot_2025-10-07_09.41.40.png "Select DB Generated TDE Master Encryption Key Attribute Report")

## Task 5: Track database key and certificate lifetimes

1. Click the **Reports** tab

    ![Key Vault](./images/Screenshot_2025-10-04_15.46.44.png "Click the Reports Tab")

2. Expand the **Keys and Wallets Report**

    ![Key Vault](./images/Screenshot_2025-10-05_10.06.42.png "Keys and Wallets Report")

3. Select **Certificate Awareness Report**  - to see an example of a report to track certificate lifetimes

    Here you can see the key sizes of certificates (to see if any of them are not meeting your organization's compliance requirements) and the remaining certificate lifetime (by expiration or deactivation time) so that your administrator knows when the certificates need to be rotated.

    ![Key Vault](./images/Screenshot_2025-10-05_10.08.23.png "Select Certificate Awareness Report")

4. Select **DB Activated TDE Master Encryption Key Report**  - to see an example of a report with the inventory of database encryption keys

    This report shows the most recently activated key by the database, the time it was activated and the database & the PDB that activated it. You can use this report to see when the keys were most recently rotated for a database to ensure your keys remain compliant.

    ![Key Vault](./images/image-2025-09-11-18.09.03.png "Select DB Activated TDE Master Encryption Key Report")

## Task 6: Receive notifications for urgent tasks

1. Click the **Reports** tab and click the **Alerts** tab on the left-side panel 

    ![Key Vault](./images/Screenshot_2025-10-04_15.49.25.png "Click the Alerts Tab")

3. Alerts that required immediate attention

    The alerts report lets the relevant administrators take action on critical tasks that may bring downtime to your operations. This photo shows several such examples:
    - Several user's (KVADMIN, KVAUDITOR, KVSYSTEM) passwords are expiring and need to be reset
    - Several certificate objects are expiring within a certain threshold of time (this threshold can be altered to suit your needs) and need to be rotated

    These notifications can be sent over remote syslog, SNMP or email notifications depending on your organizational needs.

    **NEED TO UPDATE PHOTO TO SHOW EXPIRING KEYS ALSO**
    ![Key Vault](./images/image-2025-09-11-18.27.41.png "Alerts that required immediate attention")

## Task 7: Ensure accountability with audit records

To support security and compliance requirements, Oracle Key Vault reporting includes a complete audit trail, enabling thorough tracking and review of all actions and events. This is available to all administrators.

1. Click the **Reports** tab and click the **Audit Trail** tab on the left-side panel 

    ![Key Vault](./images/Screenshot_2025-10-05_10.41.36.png "Click the Audit Trail Tab")

2. The audit trail page shows all audit records for your Key Vault deployment

    Here you can see which subject (user, or endpoint) performed what action on which object, the time it happened at and whether or not it was successfully completed. Audit managers can use the **Audit Settings** button to filter for custom events and also select which events they want to be audited. 

    ![Key Vault](./images/Screenshot_2025-10-07_09.55.44.png "The audit trail page")

## Task 8: Enforce separation of duties

For separation of duties, Key Vault offers 3 different types of administrator roles, a system administrator, a key administrator and an audit manager. Together, these 3 administrators are responsible for managing the entire server but there also exists specific privileges like create endpoints, create endpoint groups and a monitor privilege. These privileges don't grant a complete administrative access but provide some escalation in roles and allow for non-privileged users to perform those specific tasks.

For user administration in Oracle Key Vault, users can exist as a local Key Vault user, or users that are part of your organization through an LDAP configuration or SSO configuration. The role of account management is undertaken by the system administrator. To perform these tasks:

1. Click the **Users** tab

    ![Key Vault](./images/Screenshot_2025-10-04_15.54.38.png "Click the Users tab")

2. This takes you to the **Manager Users** page

    ![Key Vault](./images/image-2025-09-11-18.29.46.png "Expand Keys and Wallets Reports and click on Certificate Awareness Report")

3. To change the Key Vault user password, click the **Change Password** tab on the left-side panel

    ![Key Vault](./images/Screenshot_2025-10-05_10.49.21.png "To change the Key Vault user password, click the Change Password tab on the left-side panel")

4. The **Change Password for &lt;Key Vault User&gt;** page is where the user can change the password

    ![Key Vault](./images/image-2025-09-11-18.42.01.png "The Change Password for <Key Vault User> page is where the user can change the password")

5. For deployments using LDAP, key administrators can manage access for users to specific wallets by setting up LDAP group mappings. Click **Manage LDAP Mappings** on the left-side panel.

    ![Key Vault](./images/Screenshot_2025-10-05_10.54.01.png "Click Manage LDAP Mappings on the left-side panel")

6. The **LDAP Group Mappings** page shows which mappings are setup to which roles and privileges in Key Vault

    ![Key Vault](./images/image-2025-09-11-18.33.10.png "The LDAP Group Mappings page shows which mappings are setup to which roles and privileges in Key Vault")

## Task 9: Assess system health

1. To assess the health of the Key Vault server, click the **System** tab

    ![Key Vault](./images/Screenshot_2025-10-05_11.10.42.png "To assess the health of the Key Vault server, click the System tab")

2. This page shows the system health

    Note the various classes of information shown on this page:
    - The base server information
    - The state of critical system services
    - Information about space usage
    - Deployment related information
    - Certificate state

    ![Key Vault](./images/Screenshot_2025-10-05_11.07.08.png "This page shows the system health")

## Task 10: Monitor performance for optimal Oracle Key Vault operations

System administrators can monitor the performance of the Key Vault server to check on the underlying machine the server is running on to ensure the system is performing optimally. Administrators can check the **CPU & Memory Metrics**, the **Disk I/O Metrics**, the **Network Metrics**, and the **Application Metrics**.

1. Click the **System** tab

    ![Key Vault](./images/Screenshot_2025-10-05_11.10.42.png "Click the System tab")

3. This takes you to the page from where the system administrator can administer the Key Vault server

    System administrators will look at and perform configuration for the Key Vault server from this page. Administration for the server is grouped by **Network Details**, **Monitoring and Alerts**, **System Configuration**, **Certificates**, and **Network Services**.

    ![Key Vault](./images/image-2025-09-11-18.48.38-CUSTOM.png "This takes you to the page from where the system administrator can administer the Key Vault server")

## Task 12: A quick look at the cluster

For a quick look at the cluster deployment, here is an example of the server being converted to a cluster node. This deployment shows the cluster with the controller node (the first server of the cluster). This node will have all the existing keys and will seed the cluster.

1. Click the **Cluster** tab

    ![Key Vault](./images/Screenshot_2025-10-05_11.33.32.png "Click the Cluster tab")

2. Configure the server as a Candidate Node

    ![Key Vault](./images/image-2025-09-11-18.50.51.png "Expand Keys and Wallets Reports and click on Certificate Awareness Report")

3. Once the server has been configured as a cluster node, the Cluster page is updated to show the status of all nodes that are part of this cluster

    ![Key Vault](./images/image-2025-09-11-18.58.43.png "Expand Keys and Wallets Reports and click on Certificate Awareness Report")

4. On the Home page, the System Overview section at the bottom is updated (identifying the deployment mode as Cluster)

    This section will show how many read-write pairs are part of the cluster as well as the cluster service status.
