# Introduction

## About this Workshop
### Overview
*Estimated Time to complete the workshop*: 90 minutes

This workshop is the second part of the Hands-On Labs series on Oracle Database Security. For the first part, see *DB Security Basics*.

Based on an OCI architecture, deployed in a few minutes with a simple internet connection, it allows you to test DB Security use cases in a complete environment already pre-configured by the Oracle Database Security Product Manager Team.

Now, you no longer need important resources on your PC (storage, CPU or memory), nor complex tools to master, making you completely autonomous to discover at your pace all new DB Security features.

### Components
The complete architecture of the **DB Security Hands-On Labs** is as following:

It's composed of 5 VMs:
  - **DBSec-Lab VM** (mandatory for all workshops: Baseline and Advanced workshops)
  - **Audit Vault Server VM** (for Advanced workshop only)
  - **DB Firewall Server VM** (for Advanced workshop only)
  - **Key Vault Server VM** (for Advanced workshop only)
  - **DB23ai VM** (for SQL Firewall workshop only)

During this mini-lab, you'll use different resources to interact with these VMs:
  - SSH Terminal Client
  - Oracle Enterprise Manager 24ai
  - SQL Developer

### Objectives
This mini-lab provides an opportunity to learn how to configure DB Security features to protect and secure databases, from the Baseline to the Maximum Security Architecture (MSA), by exploring Oracle Data Masking and Subsetting (DMS) features.

The entire DB Security PM team wishes you an excellent workshop!

You may now [proceed to the next lab](#next).
