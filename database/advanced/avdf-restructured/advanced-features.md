### Step 1: Tracking Data Changes for pdb1 (Auditing "Before-After" Values)

**About Oracle Audit Vault Transaction Log Audit Trail Collection**

REDO LOG files also known as TRANSACTION LOG are files used by Oracle Database to maintain logs of all the transactions that have occurred in the database. This chapter contains the recommendations for setting initialization parameters to use the **Transaction Log Audit Trail** type to collect audit data from the Redo Logs of Oracle Database target.

These log files allow Oracle Database to **recover the changes made to the database in case of a failure**. For example, if a user updates a salary value in a table that contains employee related data, a REDO record is generated. It contains the value **BEFORE** this change (old value) and the **NEW** changed value. REDO records are used **to guarantee ACID** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) **properties over crash or hardware failure**. In case of a database crash, the system performs redo (re-process) of all the changes on data files that takes the database data back to the state it was when the last REDO record was written.

REDO log records contain Before and After values for every **DML** (Data Manipulation Language) and **DDL** (Data Definition Language) operations. Oracle AVDF provides the ability to **monitor the changed values from REDO logs using Transaction Log collector**.

Transaction Log collector takes advantage of **Oracle GoldenGateâ€™s Integrated Extract process** to move the REDO log data from database to XML files. The extract process is configured to run against the source database or it is configured to run on a Downstream Mining database (Oracle only). It captures DML and DDL operations performed on the configured objects. **The captured operations from transaction logs are transferred to GoldenGate XML trail files**. Oracle AVDF's Transaction Log collector, collects transaction log records from generated XML files. **These logs are forwarded to the Audit Vault Server** to show the before and after values changed in the Data Modification Before-After Values report. The DDL changes are available in the All Activity report. The DML changes are available in the Data Modification Before-After Values report.

**Getting Started**

The first thing we need to do is to set up the database to be ready for Golden Gate

1. Go back to your terminal session on DBSec-Lab VM to create the Golden Gate Database Administration user **C##AVGGADMIN** in the container database **cdb1**

    ````
    <copy>./avs_create_oggadmin_db_user.sh</copy>
    ````

    ![AVDF](./images/avdf-025.png "Create the Golden Gate Database Administration user")

2. Next, we have to configure the database to have the appropriate `SGA_TARGET` and `STREAMS_POOL_SIZE` values, enable the `ENABLE_GOLDENGATE_REPLICATION` initialization parameter and **Forcing Logging** for redo collection

    ````
    <copy>./avs_configure_db_for_ogg.sh</copy>
    ````

    ![AVDF](./images/avdf-026.png "Configure the database")

     **Note**: This will require a reboot and this script will do this for you

3. Finally, verify connectivity to the **cdb1** container database before we continue with the configuration of the GoldenGate Extract

    ````
    <copy>./avs_test_dbuser_connectivity.sh</copy>
    ````

    ![AVDF](./images/avdf-027.png "Check connectivity to the database")

**Configuring a GoldenGate Extract**

4. In the DBSecLab VM, the Oracle GoldenGate software has been already installed and pre-configured, but ensure the Golden Gate Administration Service is up and running

    ````
    <copy>./avs_start_ogg.sh</copy>
    ````

    ![AVDF](./images/avdf-028.png "Start the Golden Gate Administration Service")

5. Login to your GoldenGate Web Console

    - Open a web browser window to *`http://dbsec-lab:50002`*

        **Note**:If you are not using the remote desktop you can also access this page by going to *`http://<DBSecLab-VM_@IP-Public>:50002`*

    - Login to Golden Gate Web Console as *`OGGADMIN`* with the password "*`Oracle123`*"

        ````
        <copy>oggadmin</copy>
        ````

        ````
        <copy>Oracle123</copy>
        ````

        ![AVDF](./images/avdf-029.png "Golden Gate - Login")

    - Password: *`Oracle123`*
    - Verify Password: *`Oracle123`*

        ![AVDF](./images/avdf-030c.png "Create a new Credential")

    - Click [**Submit**]

9. Under **Action**, press the **Verify** button for the **cdb1** Domain

    ![AVDF](./images/avdf-031.png "Verify connectivity")

10. If your connection was successful, you should now see a **Checkpoint**, a **Transaction Information** and a **Heartbeat** section

    ![AVDF](./images/avdf-032.png "Check your connection")

11. Now we will navigate back to the GoldenGate Administration Server dashboard
    - In the top left corner, open the **Burger menu**
    - Select **Overview**

        ![AVDF](./images/avdf-033a.png "Navigate to the GoldenGate Administration Server dashboard")

12. Create a new GoldenGate Extract

    ![AVDF](./images/avdf-043b.png "See a Before-After values output")

    **Note:** If you are not seeing Before/After value changes in Audit Vault:
    - **Restart OGG** (Oracle Golden Gate) Extracts (from the Golden Gate Web Console, click [**Action**] for the `pdb1` extract, stop and start it)
    - Ensure you properly executed the scripts in `Before_and_After_Changes` folder to create the "`C##GGAVADMIN`" user and setup the database
    - Check if the Timezone of your Audit Trail is correctly set to your VM Timezone
    - Check your Audit Trail is up and running

### Step 2: PostgreSQL Audit Collection
The objective of this lab is to collect audit log records from PostgreSQL databases (with pgaudit configured) into Oracle Audit Vault and Database Firewall:
- Ensure to that **pgaudit** is installed extension:
    - The PostgreSQL Audit Extension (or pgaudit) provides detailed session and/or object audit logging via the standard logging facility provided by PostgreSQL
    - The audit collection will be incomplete and operational details are missed out from the reports in case this extension is not enabled
- Make sure that the `LOG_DESTINATION` parameter is set to **CSVLOG** in postgresql.conf file:
    - The AVDF PostgreSQL audit collector will only be able to process CSV files
- Parameter `LOGGING_COLLECTOR` needs to be set to **ON**
- The AVDF Agent OS user needs to have read permission on the directory specified on the `LOG_DIRECTORY` parameter and the generated CSV files to be able to read them

1. Go to the scripts directory

    ````
    <copy>cd $DBSEC_LABS/avdf/adv</copy>
    ````

2. Run the script as **postgres** user to setup the pgaudit and load data

    ````
    <copy>sudo -u postgres ./adv_pgsql_init.sh</copy>
    ````

    ![AVDF](./images/avdf-201.png "Setup the pgaudit and load data")

3. Next, go back to Audit Vault Web Console as *`AVADMIN`*"

    ![AVDF](./images/avdf-400.png "AVDF - Login")

4. Click the **Targets** tab

5. Click [**Register**]

    ![AVDF](./images/avdf-202.png "Register the database")

6. Use the following information for your new target details

    - Name: *`PostgreSQL`*
    - Type: *`PostgreSQL`*
    - Description: *`PostgreSQL Database`*
    - Connection string: *`dbsec-lab`*
    - Leave the `USER NAME` and `PASSWORD` blank because we are going to use a "**Directory**" collector

        ![AVDF](./images/avdf-203.png "Target details")

    - Add "Attributes
    
        - Click the **Audit Collection Attributes** sub-tab

        - Click [**Add**] and enter values as following:

            - Name: *`av.collector.securedTargetVersion`*  /  Value: *`15.0`*
            - Name: *`av.collector.timezoneoffset`*  /  Value: `<YOUR_DBSECLAB-VM_TIMEZONE>` (here UTC Time: "*`0:00`*")

                ![AVDF](./images/avdf-204.png "Audit Collection Attributes")

**Note:** If you already have one entry for 11.0 then delete that attribute and add new with the value 15.0.

    - Click [**Save**]

7. In the **Audit Data Collection** section, click [**Add**]

    ![AVDF](./images/avdf-205.png "Add Audit Data Collection")

8. In the **Add Audit Trail** window add the following

    - Audit Trail Type: *`DIRECTORY`*
    - Trail Location: *`/var/log/pgsql`*
    - Agent Host: *`dbseclab`*

        ![AVDF](./images/avdf-206.png "Add Audit Trail")

    - Click [**Save**]

9. Refresh the page until you see the **IDLE** status

    ![AVDF](./images/avdf-207.png "Check the Audit Trail status")

10. Go back to your terminal session and generate traffic on the PostgreSQL database for auditing

    ````
    <copy>./adv_pgsql_generate_traffic.sh</copy>
    ````

    ![AVDF](./images/avdf-208.png "Generate traffic")

11. Next, go back to Audit Vault Web Console as *`AVAUDITOR`*

    ![AVDF](./images/avdf-300.png "AVDF - Login")

    - You should see a lot of audit details about this particular audited event

        ![AVDF](./images/avdf-212.png "List of audit details")

16. Once you are comfortable, you can now reset the PostgreSQL audit configuration

    - Delete the "PostgreSQL" target
    
        - Go back to Audit Vault Web Console as *`AVADMIN`*"

            ![AVDF](./images/avdf-400.png "AVDF - Login")

        - Click the **Targets** tab

        - Click "**Audit Trails**" sub-menu
        
        - Select "**PostgreSQL**" Audit Trail and click [**Stop**]

            ![AVDF](./images/avdf-212b.png "Stop Audit Trail")

        - Click [**OK**] to confirm the shutdown
