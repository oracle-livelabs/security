## Introduction

Oracle Universal Authenticator is a unified authentication solution that provides device authentication and cross-platform single-sign on (SSO) to web-based and desktop applications.

Users login to their devices using either password-less login, or with their Oracle Access Management (OAM) credentials. Users can then access protected applications without the need to enter their single-sign on credentials again.

Oracle Universal Authenticator provides phishing-resistant MFA and passwordless protection for devices and applications, strengthening your organization's security framework and preventing phishing attacks. This comprehensive solution works seamlessly with Oracle Access Manager (OAM) by leveraging Oracle Advanced Authentication (OAA) and Oracle Adaptive Risk Management (OARM) as an integrated suite to provide the SSO experience from trusted devices to all entitled applications using various authentication methods.

Key Features:

* Trusted Device Login with SSO: Secure access to all entitled applications from trusted devices

* Diverse Authentication Methods: Includes MFA, passwordless, adaptive, and mobile authentication for devices and applications

* Central Self-Service Management: Offers options for self-service authentication factors

* Centralized Administration: Extends OAA Admin console for granular rule management for step-up authentications
