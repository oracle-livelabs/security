# Activation of the Identity Domain and Creating a Confidential App for REST API Calls

## Introduction

During the stack execution process, An Oracle Identity Domain of the type of **Oracle Apps Premium** is created. The administrator account you used will get an auto generated email for resetting the password for that respective user. In this module we will showcase the steps to reset the password for the admin users and the procedure to login into the newly created Oracle Apps Premium Domain. 

This module will also help you to create a confidential application under the newly created Identity Domain, which will be used for making REST API calls in the backend.

*Estimated Lab Time:* 10 minutes

### Objectives

1.	**Reset** the password for the admin user and login into the newly created Identity Domain.
2. 	Create a **Confidential application** in OCI IAM with the allowed grant type as *Client Credentials*

## Task 1: Reset the password for the admin user and login into the newly created Domain

1. During the stack execution process you will get an autogenerated email which would have an **Activate your Account** Button. Please click on it.
 
	**Sample Email:**  ![sample-email](./images/image1.jpg "sample-email")
 
2. On the page that gets loaded, please **reset your password** for your admin account under your newly created Domain.

## Task 2: Create a confidential application 

We will register a Confidential Application under newly created OCI-IAM Domain with the allowed grants type **Client Credentials**

1. Under your newly created **Identity Domain**, Copy the **Identity Domain URL** from the **Domain Information** section. Click on **Applications** from the navigation menu.

## Conclusion

In this Lab, we activated the Admin user under your newly created Identity Domain of the type- Oracle Apps Premium and then created a confidential application for REST API, which is to be used further in the Terraform scripts. 

 You may now **proceed to the next lab.**
