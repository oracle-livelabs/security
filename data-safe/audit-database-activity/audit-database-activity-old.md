# Audit database activity

## Introduction

In this lab, you use the auditing wizard to enable alert and audit policies on your target database, start audit data collection in Oracle Data Safe, and configure the retention periods for your audit data. Audit resources for Oracle Data Safe (audit profiles, audit policies, and audit trails) are automatically created for all registered target databases. You then perform activity on your target database and review the alerts and audit events generated in Oracle Data Safe.

Estimated Lab Time: 15 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Configure auditing and alerts for your target database
- Review the Activity Auditing dashboard and audit policy
- Perform activities on your target database to generate audit data
- Review alerts in Oracle Data Safe
- Review audit events in Oracle Data Safe


### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

- Obtained an Oracle Cloud account
- Signed in to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console
- Prepared your environment for this workshop
- Registered your target database with Oracle Data Safe


### Assumptions

- Your data values may be different than those shown in the screenshots.
- Please ignore the dates for the data and database names. Screenshots are taken at various times and may differ between labs and within labs.

    ![Activity Auditing wizard - Audit Policy bottom](images/activity-auditing-wizard-audit-policy2.png "Activity Auditing wizard - Audit Policy bottom")

6. For **Audit trails**, do the following to start collecting audit data, and then click **Next**.

    a) Select **UNIFIED\_AUDIT\_TRAIL: NOT_STARTED**.

    b) For the start date, select the beginning of the month.

    ![Activity Auditing wizard - Audit trails](images/activity-auditing-wizard-audit-trails.png "Activity Auditing wizard - Audit Trails")

7. For **Audit profile**, leave the default selections for retention period and paid usage as is (see below), and click **Next**.

    - Audit data online retention months = 12
    - Audit data offline retention months = 0
    - Paid usage = selected

    ![Activity Auditing wizard - Audit profile](images/activity-auditing-wizard-audit-profile.png "Activity Auditing wizard - Audit profile")

    - Each regional Oracle Data Safe service in a tenancy has global settings for paid usage, online retention period, and archive retention period.
    - Global settings are applied to all target databases unless their audit profiles override them.
    - All initial audit profile settings for your target database are inherited from the global settings for Oracle Data Safe.
    - By default, paid usage is enabled for all target databases, the online retention period is set to the maximum value of 12 months, and the archive retention period is set to the minimum value of 0 months. Note that you cannot enable paid usage for a free trial account.

8. For **Review and submit**, review the configuration, and click **Submit** if everything is correct.

    ![Activity Auditing wizard - Review and submit](images/activity-auditing-wizard-review-submit.png "Activity Auditing wizard - Review and submit")

9. For **Audit configuration progress**, wait until the alert and audit policies are provisioned and the audit trail is started.

    ![Activity Auditing wizard - Audit configuration progress errors](images/audit-configuration-progress-errors.png "Activity Auditing wizard - Audit configuration progress errors")


10. Click **Close**.


## Task 2: Review the Activity Auditing dashboard and audit policy

By default, the Activity Auditing dashboard shows you a summary of audit events for the last one week for all target databases in the form of charts and tables. On the left under **List scope** and **Filters**, you can filter by compartment, time period, and target database.

1. On the **Activity auditing** page, on the left under **Filters**, select your target database.

2. Review the charts.

    - The **Audit trails** chart shows you the number of audit trails that are running, stopped, not started, and that need attention.
    - The **Failed login activity** chart shows you the number of failed logins on your target database for the last one week. You may or may not have any failed logins, depending on how you have interacted in Database Actions so far.
    - The **Admin activity** chart shows you the number of database schema changes, failed logins, audit setting changes, and entitlement changes on your target database for the last one week.
    - The **All activity** chart shows you the total count of audit events on your target database for the specified time period.

    ![Activity auditing dashboard charts2](images/aa-dashboard-charts2.png "Activity auditing dashboard charts2")


3. Review the **Events summary** and **Targets summary** tabs.

    - Statistics include the number of target databases that have an audit event in each event category and the total number of events per category. Because you are viewing statistics for your target database only, the **Target databases** column shows ones.
    - Audit events include the number of login failures, schema changes, entitlement changes, audit settings changes, all activity (all audit events), Database Vault all violations, and Database Vault policy changes.

    ![Targets summary tab](images/targets-summary-tab3.png "Targets summary tab")  



## Task 3: Perform activities on your target database to generate audit data

In this task, you perform activities on your target database in Database Actions to generate some audit data. First, purposely try to log in as the `ADMIN` user with incorrect passwords. Then, sign in and create a user account.

1. Return to the SQL worksheet in Database Actions.

2. Sign out of Database Actions.

    The **Sign-in** page is displayed.

3. In the **Username** box, enter `ADMIN`.

4. Do this twice: Enter an incorrect password, and then click **Sign in**. 

    An **Invalid credentials** message is displayed.

    ![Invalid database password message](images/invalid-database-password.png "Invalid database password message")

5. Enter the correct password, and click **Sign in**.

    If you are using a Sandbox environment, you can find the database password in the LiveLabs reservation.

6. If needed, click the **SQL** tile.

7. Clear the worksheet, and then paste the following SQL script. Replace `your-password` with a password of your choice. The password must be between 12 and 30 characters long and must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one numeric character. It cannot contain your username or the double quote (") character.

    ```
    <copy>drop user MALFOY cascade;
    create user MALFOY identified by your-password;
    grant PDB_DBA to MALFOY;</copy>
    ```


8. On the toolbar, click the **Run Script** button and wait for the script to finish running. 

9. In the script output, verify that the `MALFOY` user was successfully dropped and then recreated.

10. Return to the browser tab for Oracle Data Safe and wait a couple of minutes for Oracle Data Safe to produce the alerts.


## Task 4: Review alerts in Oracle Data Safe

1. Under **Security center** on the left, click **Alerts**.

2. Under **Filters** on the left, select your target database.

3. Review the alerts dashboard.

    - The **Alerts summary** chart compares the number of critical, high, and medium alerts.
    - The **Open alerts** chart shows that there are open alerts on the current day.
    - The **Top 10 alert policies by volume** chart shows you the number of alerts for the alert policies you just configured.
    - The **Alerts summary** tab shows the number of critical, high, and medium alerts along with target database counts. It also shows you the total number of alerts and target databases. 
    - The **Targets summary** tab shows the number of open, critical, high, and medium alerts.

    ![Alerts dashboard charts](images/alerts-dashboard-charts.png "Alerts dashboard charts")
    ![Alerts summary tab](images/alerts-dashboard-alerts-summary-tab.png "Alerts summary tab")
    ![Targets summary tab](images/alerts-dashboard-targets-summary-tab.png "Targets summary tab")


4. Under **Related resources**, click **Reports**.

5. In the **Report name** column on the right, click the **All alerts** report and review it.

    - The report is automatically filtered to show you all alerts for all target databases in the selected compartment for the past one week. To create filters, you can use the **+ Another filter** button or the **SCIM query builder**. 
    - You can view several totals, including the total number of target databases; total number of open and closed alerts, and the total number of critical, high, medium, and low alerts. You can click the **Targets** total to view the list of target databases. You can click the other totals to toggle a filter on the list of alerts.
    - At the bottom of the report, you can view the list of alerts. By default, the table shows you the alert name, alert status, alert severity, target databases on which the audited event occurred, when the alert was created, and the alert policy rule name.
    - You have options to create a PDF or XLS report, create a custom report, schedule a custom report, open and close alerts, and specify which table columns you want displayed on the page.

## Task 5: Review audit events in Oracle Data Safe

1. On the left under **Security center**, click **Activity auditing**.

2. From the **Target databases** drop-down list on the left, select your target database. 

3. On the **Events summary** tab, click one of the event categories, for example, **Login failures by admin** to view more detail.
