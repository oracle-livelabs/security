This lab walks you through the steps to get started using **Oracle Access Governance** with a popular use case - **policy review certification campaign**. In this workshop, a ficticious corporation is using **Oracle IAM** to manage and govern their Cloud resources. As part of their cloud strategy, they want to optimize their policy review certification campaign process with a cloud-native solution. **Oracle Access Governance** SaaS solution is designed for this purpose and serves as a natural extension of **Oracle IAM**. With **Oracle Access Governance**, they can immediately benefit from automated policy review workflows that layer in prescriptive analytics with intuitive dashboards/reports. 

**Oracle Access Governance** allows : 
- **Campaign administrator** to run intelligent access review campaigns for policy governance and compliance
- **Access reviewers** to review identity insights and take informed decisions based on **prescriptive analytics**
- **Users** and **user managers** to validate access assigned to self and their direct reports, respectively. 
- **Reviewers** to review OCI group membership and change as needed.
