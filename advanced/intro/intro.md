# Introduction

## About this Workshop
### Overview
*Estimated Time to complete the workshop*: 425 minutes

This workshop is the SECOND PART of the Hands-On Labs dedicated to the Oracle Database Security features and functionalities - for the first workshop, please refer to the *DB Security Basics*.

Based on an OCI architecture, deployed in a few minutes with a simple internet connection, it allows you to test DB Security use cases in a complete environment already pre-configured by the Oracle Database Security Product Manager Team.

Now, you no longer need important resources on your PC (storage, CPU or memory), nor complex tools to master, making you completely autonomous to discover at your rhythm all new DB Security features.
