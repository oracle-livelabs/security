  9. To make a review decision, you can either revoke all or accept all actionable statements in that policy at once, or make decision individually on each policy statement. For this tutorial, let us validate 2 usecases:

    **Usecase 1:**  Revoke policy statement from a policy - **auditors-policy**

      - Let’s revoke the policy statement **Allow group Auditors to read audit-events in compartment Quality-Assurance** from the policy  **auditors-policy**. 


      - Click on the cross button under Actions column for the policy statement **Allow group Auditors to read audit-events in compartment Quality-Assurance**

      ![Access Governance Homepage](images/revoke-auditor-policy.png)

      - Click on **Apply**

      ![Access Governance Homepage](images/apply-auditor-policy.png)

      -  Enter justification for why you revoke the access review items and accept the remaining items then click on **Submit** This will trigger the auto-remediation process in the Oracle Access Governance system.

    **Usecase 2:**  Revoke an entire policy - **security-admins-policy** 

      - Let's revoke the entire policy **security-admins-policy** 

      - Click on the Revoke All button.
