This workshop is the Hands-On Labs dedicated to the Oracle Database Security features and functionalities.

Based on an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure architecture, deployed in a few minutes with a simple internet connection, it allows you to test Autonomous Database with DB Vault use cases in a complete environment already pre-configured by the Oracle Database Security Product Manager Team.
