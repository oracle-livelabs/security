## About this Workshop
### Overview
*Estimated Time to complete the workshop*: 55 minutes

This workshop is the Hands-On Labs dedicated to the Oracle Database Security features and functionalities.

Based on an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure architecture, deployed in a few minutes with a simple internet connection, it allows you to test Autonomous Database with security use cases in a complete environment already pre-configured by the Oracle Database Security Product Manager Team.

Now, you no longer need important resources on your PC (storage, CPU or memory), nor complex tools to master, making you completely autonomous to discover at your leisure how to use Data Redacation to better protect your Autonomous Database.
